### Introduction to HTML

- Developed by *Tim Berners-Lee* in 1993; maintained by W3C.  
- HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is based on SGML.  
- Originated at CERN, Geneva, in 1989.  
- Not a programming language—it's a **markup language** used to design **static web pages**.  
- Used for creating web elements: headings, images, buttons, etc.  
- Executes on the **client-side** (browser).  
- Supported by all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari, etc.).  
- **Cross-platform compatible**, **case-insensitive**, and **error-free**.  
- No additional software needed—write in Notepad, run in a browser.  
- Browser interprets HTML line-by-line (interpreter-based).  
- **Freeware** and **open-source**.

### **Tags in HTML**

- Tags are the **building blocks** of HTML.  
- A tag is a predefined instruction the browser understands.  
- Wrong or unknown tags are ignored or printed as plain text.
